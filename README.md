# vignette-group_6

Vignette on implementing isolation forest anomaly detection to identify credit card fraud; created as a class project for PSTAT197A in Fall 2022.

## Abstract
Isolation Forest (iForest) is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm which is used for anomaly detection. We will be using iForests to detect credit card fraud or money laundering. This repository will implement the iForest algorithm in both R and Python to allow for application to projects in different languages. 

## Repository contents
data - contains 2 files, creditcard.RData and creditcard.csv.  These are the datasets that the vignette will use.
