## Abstract
Isolation Forest (iForest) is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm which is used for anomaly detection. We will be using iForests to detect credit card fraud or money laundering. This repository will implement the iForest algorithm in both R and Python to allow for application to projects in different languages. Our R implementation has a 95% AUROC score
